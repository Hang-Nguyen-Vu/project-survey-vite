# Survey Project
This is a simple survey about fitness activities and goal, using React state and controlled forms.

### The Problem

We divided the tasks among the team members. The survey has five questions using different types of inputs (dropdown list, checkboxes, radio buttons, text and text area). When the user presses submit, they are able to see a summary of their answers.

Potential improvements include:
- Creating a range slider and connecting it to React state.
- Visualizing to the user how far through the survey they are, and how much is left, by creating a progress bar
- Using Regex validation for some input in the survey
- Showing different questions depending on the answer to a specific question
